# Inventory System — Quick Start

## To use the system you need

* Player prefab: `InventoryOwner` and `BindInventoryToUIFromPlayer` attached (already overridden in my branch).
* UI: Canvas with InventoryPanel that has InventoryUIPresenter attached.
* Slot prefab: `UI_invSlot` (already in my branch).

## To create usable stuff

1. Create data: *Create → RPG → Items → Item Definition* (set Id, name, icon, category, stack rules).
2. Create action: *Create → RPG → Items → Actions → …* (e.g., Use Potion, Read Lore, Use Key) and add it to the definition’s Actions list.
3. Resources rule: All ItemDefinition assets must live under a Resources folder (e.g., `Assets/Resources/Items/`).

## Notes

* Actions are mostly placeholders right now—they can be invoked but may not have in‑game effects yet. This will change after Sami finishes the refactor.
* Buttons are wired in code; no need to set OnClick in Inspector.
* If the Inventory panel is disabled at start, it will still sync when opened (presenter caches latest snapshot).
